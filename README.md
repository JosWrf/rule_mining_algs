# Code Repository for Assocation Rule Mining Algorithms

In this repository different association rule mining algorithms will be implemented and tested against different datasets from several fields simulating various use cases. In the first step
a framework of the different algorithm implementations is built, which is then extended into a simple app, to compare the algorithms with different inputs and paramerters.

## Different Algorithms

- AIS Algorithm
- Apriori Algorithm
- Tree Algorithm and Variants
- Algorithm
- Constraint-based Algorithms
- Multidimenional Algorithms

## Ideas and open problems

```
Decide what the input format will be (csv, .sqlite, .sql, .json, ...) ?
Decide on the specific algorithms.
CLI, GUI or WebApp ?
Get data (spatial? , only transactional?, data with timestamps)
Use algorithms from libraries or still try to implement them on my own, but use libs when available and faster?
```

## TODO

```
- Implement AIS Algorithm
- Implement Apriori Algorithm
- Implement FP-Tree Algorithm and Variants
- Implement RARM Algorithm
- Implement Constraint-based Algorithms
- Implement Multidimenional Algorithms
```
