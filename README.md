# Code Repository for Assocation Rule Mining Algorithms

In this repository different association rule mining algorithms will be implemented and tested against different datasets from several fields simulating various use cases. In the first step
a framework of the different algorithm implementations is built.
(Maybe this framework will be embedded in a dash app if there's any time left.)

## Different Algorithms thus far

- AIS
- Apriori
- FP-Growth
- Quantitative Association Rules
- AClose
- Minimal Non-redundant rules
- Rule Generation for apriori-like Algorihtms

## Datasets
- store_data.csv: [Store data](https://user.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/~sherbold/store_data.csv)

- agaricus-lepiota.data: [Mushroom dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom)


## TODO

```
- Implement Multilevel Algorithms
- Implement Static Discretization
- Implement ARM based Classification Algorithms
```
