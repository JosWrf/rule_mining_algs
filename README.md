# Code Repository for Assocation Rule Mining Algorithms

In this repository different association rule mining algorithms will be implemented and tested against different datasets from several fields simulating various use cases. In the first step
a framework of the different algorithm implementations is built.
(Maybe this framework will be embedded in a dash app if there's any time left.)

## Different Algorithms thus far

- AIS
- Apriori
- FP-Growth
- Quantitative Association Rules
- AClose
- Minimal Non-redundant rules
- Rule Generation for apriori-like Algorithms
- Brute-Force Mining of Classification Rules
- Clustering to find intervals for numeric attributes
- Evolutionary Algorithm to Discover Itemsets (very slow)

## Datasets

- store_data.csv: [Store data](https://user.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/~sherbold/store_data.csv)

- agaricus-lepiota.data: [Mushroom dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom)

## TODO

```
- The Evolutionary Algorithm's result needs to be integrated in the rule generation framework
- Implement ARM based Classification Algorithms
- Might consider Spatial Association Rules
```
